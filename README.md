# Aspect's Bazel helpers library

This is code we would contribute to bazel-skylib,
but the declared scope of that project is narrow
and it's very difficult to get anyone's attention
to review PRs there.

## Installation

From the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/releases>
copy the WORKSPACE snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file.
