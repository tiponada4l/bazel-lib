rem Usage of rlocation function:
rem        call :rlocation <runfile_path> <abs_path>
rem        The rlocation function maps the given <runfile_path> to its absolute
rem        path and stores the result in a variable named <abs_path>.
rem        This function fails if the <runfile_path> doesn't exist in mainifest
rem        file.
