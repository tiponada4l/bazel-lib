# Bazel settings that apply to this repository.

# Settings that apply only to CI are in .github/workflows/ci.bazelrc

# In general, the rules in this repository assume that runfiles
# are enabled as we do not support no runfiles case.
#
# If you are developing on Windows, you must either run bazel
# with administrator priviledges or enable developer mode. If
# you do not you may hit this error on Windows:
#
#   Bazel needs to create symlinks to build the runfiles tree.
#   Creating symlinks on Windows requires one of the following:
#       1. Bazel is run with administrator privileges.
#       2. The system version is Windows 10 Creators Update (1703) or later
#          and developer mode is enabled.
build --enable_runfiles

# Turn off legacy external runfiles
# This prevents accidentally depending on this feature, which Bazel will remove.
build --nolegacy_external_runfiles

# Load any settings specific to the current user.
# .bazelrc.user should appear in .gitignore so that settings are not shared with team members
# This needs to be last statement in this
# config, as the user configuration should be able to overwrite flags from this file.
# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/best-practices.html#bazelrc
# (Note that we use .bazelrc.user so the file appears next to .bazelrc in directory listing,
# rather than user.bazelrc as suggested in the Bazel docs)
